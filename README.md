CIS7 Course Project 
Overview
In this course project, you will work with team members solve problems in discrete mathematics and
create a C++ program that includes the representation of the solutions. This project encapsulates the
application of discrete structures concepts and theories in programming.
You will be graded on the following:
 Ability to apply discrete structures concepts and theory in C++ programming: 40 points.
 Ability to provide explanation of solutions and approaches in documentation: 40 points.
 Ability to be plan, organize, and work collaboratively in a team: 20 points.
Team for project:
 2 or more members per team. Maximum of 3 people in a team.
 Each team will select 1 project case of interest.
Project Cases:
In each team, select 1 project case. The project scenarios are as followed:
Case 1: Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel
A solar marketing specialist travels from Riverside to Moreno Valley, then to Perris and Hemet to market
solar packages to homeowners. The travel route is shown below:

1. If the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, determine the variations of
the trip to the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products.
2. Determine shortest path, and the most low-cost trips for the marketing specialist.
3. Create a C++ program to provide the representation of the trips, low-cost and shortest paths,
including matrices, adjacencies.
4. Provide documentation that explains solution and programming approaches
